Hi, this is Lillian😃, 

the name of this account comes from Claude Monet, the famous French painter and founder of impressionist painting. Claudemo feels like monet on internet. Also cuz 'emo' is becoming a popular word in China, referring to a somehow sensational stuff. It would be emotional, vibrant and beautiful(sorry to can't describe it clear either, personally I think it shall be  related to an emotional arousal).

I know that coding requires strict logic, but somehow I hope to combine coding with art. Someday to use code, still inserting some termperature and feeling into the projects. Someday.
