Hi, this is Lillian, 
the name of this account comes from claude monet, the French painter and founder of impressionist painting, it feels like monet on internet. Also cuz claudemo, the 'emo' in this world refers to a somehow sensational stuff. It would be emotional, but vibrant and beautiful(sorry to can't describe it clear either, personally I think it shall be  related to an emotional arousal).

Coding requires strict logic, but somehow I hope to combine coding with art. Someday to use code, still inserting some termperature and feeling into the projects. Someday.
